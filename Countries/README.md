# Notice 
Some EU countries share the missile inventory. So the EU-{1,2} categories differentiation 
is not strictly enforced.

The EU-1 is {"UK","France","Italy"}.

The EU-2 is {"Germany","Sweden"}.

# Exceptional Case
In constrast, some countries in Europe only able to accquire either of EU-{1} OR EU-{2}.
For those cases, newly added countries' missiles stock should follow the domain countries data.
